Sluraff (pronounced "slurf" or "sloorough") is an ancient german word for a layabout.

What is it?
-
In modern web-development, there are a lot of tasks, in which you do not simply edit a CSS or HTML file, save it, and view the result in your browser.

What you do, is to create config files, watch files for changes, compress files and use different environments.

This requires you to type commands in the shell and in most cases they run in parallel and in multiple shells.

so when the case happens, where you work on 2 or maybe 3 different projects, you may have running 9 (3*3) different tasks each in its own shell.

And Sluraff wants to take away this overhead from you.

So, how do you do that?
-
Sluraff is a sort of a control-center for all your projects.
Each one of the projects with its own configuration.
You can add features to your projects. start or stop them with a click, and organize them.

Sluraff comes with a simple and intuitive gui.

And what is behind it?
-
Sluraff is built on node-webkit. thats all.
